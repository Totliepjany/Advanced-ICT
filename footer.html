<h4>In 2016, UNHCR and the National and County Governments established the Kalobeyei Integrated Settlement to decongest the Kakuma refugee camp and promote socio-economic integration with the host community. Influxes
	over the years have been driven by conflict, persecution, food insecurity but also the consequences of climate change (drought and floods).
	
	The Government’s Department of Refugee Services (DRS) is responsible for the management and coordination of refugee affairs with technical support from UNHCR.
	
	UNHCR works closely with the DRS, the County Government of Turkana, the national police service as well as more than 40 implementing and operational partners, sister UN agencies including development and private actors to provide protection and assistance to refugees, asylum-seekers and the
	host community. There are also around 60 refugee and community led organizations offering support.
	
	Latest figures can be accessed on the UNHCR Kenya statistics page.
